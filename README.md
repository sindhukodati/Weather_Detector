Hereâ€™s a sample README for a **Weather Detector** project that fetches weather information based on a place name entered by the user:
# Weather Detector ðŸŒ¤

A simple application that allows users to search for current weather conditions by entering the name of a place. The application connects to a weather API, retrieves real-time weather data, and displays it in an easy-to-understand format.

## Features

- **Search by Place Name**: Enter the name of any city or location to get real-time weather information.
- **Weather Information**: View current temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and simple interface for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for Python projects)
- API Key for OpenWeatherMap (or any preferred weather API)
- Internet connection

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-detector.git
   cd weather-detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary packages using `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the API Key**:

   - Sign up for an API key on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or another weather service provider.
   - Place your API key in the `.env` file (or directly in the code as specified).

   Example `.env` file:

   ```
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Enter the name of a city or place in the search bar.
2. Press "Search" to fetch the current weather data.
3. View details like:
   - Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
   - Humidity
   - Wind Speed
   - Weather Description (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy)

## Example

Search for **"Paris"** and get results like:

- **Temperature**
- **Date**
- **Time**
- **Weather Description**: Light Rain
